Getting Started Guide
=====================

Our artefact comes as `slicer.ova` file, which is in Open Virtual Appliance
format supported by most of virtualization software.  Use your favourite
virtualization solution (VirtualBox, VMWare) to import the virtual machine, boot
it up, and follow on-screen instructions.

Alternatively, if you don't want to use a virtual machine, go to

  https://github.com/jstolarek/slicer/

and follow `Installation` section of README.md (but skip step 2 for now - see
Disclaimer below).


Step-by-step instructions
=========================

Please follow "Reproducing examples from the paper" section of README.md


Disclaimer
==========

This file is intentionally kept very short because all the relevant
instructions are stored inside the virtual machine and the project files.

Once the artefact is accepted we will create an `icfp2017-final` tag in the
repository to mark the accepted submission and update the virtual machine
accordingly.  This tag is already being referred to in step (2) of
`Installation` section of README.md - please ignore that for now.
